# Building

## go run main.go --build

This command will build all of your static assets and place them in `/out`. In order to use this command, you will need to make sure your `SERVER_URL` environment variable is set in your `.env` file.

Godocument will take all of the relative paths you use during development and modify them into absolute paths for production.

<md-important>If you do not set a value on `SERVER_URL` in `.env`, Godocument will use `localhost:8080` when setting absolute paths.</md-important>

## Bundling Stylesheets

<md-important>Godocument uses Tailwind and Vanilla CSS for styling. `/static/css/index.css` contains the Vanilla CSS and `/static/css/output.css` contains the CSS generated by Tailwind.</md-important>

Godocument will bundle your stylesheets to reduce the number of network calls needed on the initial page load. During development, two network calls are made to introduce styling into your pages. Let's look at the `<head>` links in `/html/templates/base.html`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/css/index.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/css/output.css">
```

After bundling, these will be converted into:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="<SERVER_URL>/static/css/index.css">
```

The Vanilla CSS will be stacked on top of the Tailwind CSS, giving Tailwind priority.
