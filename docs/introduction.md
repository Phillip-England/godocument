# Introduction

## Quick and Effortless

Godocument makes building your documentation website as easy as possible. All you have to do is clone the repo, write your markdown files, and setup your config. We'll handle the rest. I built this tool with developers in mind. My main driving force is *simplicity.* Sure, we might not have all the bells and whistles you'd find in other tools, but if getting it done quick with the least amount of pain as possible sounds good to you, I think you'll feel right at home.
